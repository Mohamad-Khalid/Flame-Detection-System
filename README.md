# Flame Detection System
This project is about creating a flame detection system using the Arduino platform.  
The system is able to detect a fire and then sound an alarm.
The system detects any presence of fire by using the flame sensor which will be connected to the Arduino board. When a flame is detected, the red LED and buzzer will be activated to alert the user of potential danger. The Arduino IDE used to program the Arduino board and C/C++ programmings language used to write code for the system. This system can be used in various applications such as fire alarms, smoke detectors and more.

## Hardware 
The following hardware is required for this project: 
- Arduino platform 
- Breadboard 
- Wires 
- LEDs (green and red) 
- Buzzer 
- Flame Sensor 
- USB Cable 

 ## Software 
The following software is required for this project: 
- Arduino IDE  
- C/C++ programming language  

 ## Operation of the System 
When the system is powered on, the green LED will be active. When a fire is detected by the flame sensor, the green LED will turn off and the red LED and buzzer will turn on. This indicates that a fire has been detected.
